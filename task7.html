            <h2>Using CancellationTokens in your MVC Actions</h2>

            <p><span class="grey-rgb">CancellationTokens</span> are lightweight objects that are created by a 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationTokenSource</span>.
                When a <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationTokenSource</span>
                is cancelled, it notifies all the consumers of the 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationToken</span>. 
                This allows one central location to notify all of the code paths in your app that cancellation was requested.</p>

            <p>When cancelled, the 
                <span class="grey-rgb">IsCancellationRequested</span> property of the cancellation token will be set to 
                <span class="grey-rgb">True</span>,
                to indicate that the 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationTokenSource</span> has been cancelled. Depending on how you are using the token, 
                you may or may not need to check this property yourself. I'll touch on this a little more in the next section, 
                but for now, let's see how to use a 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationToken</span> in our action methods.</p>

            <p>Lets consider the previous example again. 
                We have a long-running action method 
                (which for example, is generating a read-only report by calling out to a number of other APIs). 
                As it as an expensive method, we want to stop executing the action as soon as possible
                if the request is cancelled by the user.</p>

            <p>The following code shows how we can hook into the central 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationTokenSource</span> for the request, 
                by injecting a 
                <span class="grey-rgb">CancellationToken</span> into the action method, and passing the parameter to the 
                <span class="grey-rgb">Task.Delay</span> call:</p>
